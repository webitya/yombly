          Generic hiring doesn’t work for sales. Sales &amp; marketing roles need sharper evaluation than traditional
          recruitment. Wrong-fit hires cost 12 months of lost revenue and disrupt growth. Most recruiters don’t
          understand quota pressures, pipeline dynamics, or GTM models.
