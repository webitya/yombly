Design & Tone Notes
•	Visual style: Clean SaaS / EdTech branding (modern fonts, consistent accent color, cards + icons, use of real-case imagery or abstract but real-data visuals).
•	Tone: Confident, expert, strategic—not fluffy. The “no-theory, only what works” vibe.
•	Layout: Modular cards, clear sections, storytelling flow: problem → solution → journey → impact → you.
•	Interactivity: Hover over case snapshots → short blurbs; maybe a sample case you can open.
